### What is the speedup of the na誰ve parallel program compared to the serial program?

- Overall much faster
- Close at smaller array sizes but gap gets larger
- Everything used 64 threads, it appeared to run more efficiently than 128 but we didn't have time to optimize threads past that ;(
- Percent parallel, IDK
- Cross over at about 100 +- 25


### What is the speedup of the 3rd law parallel program compared to the serial program?


- About the same speed up comparatively to the na誰ve approach, just a bit faster
- 64 threads for the same reason
- Percent Parallel, IDK
- Parallel was slower at 100random, crosses over before 200random


### Compare your na誰ve program to your 3rd law serial program. For what sizes is the na誰ve program faster and when is the 3rd-law program faster? What is the crossover point?

- 3rd law is always faster in serial
- For Parallel, the crossover point is somewhere between 200 and 1000
